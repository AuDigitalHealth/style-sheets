### > Generic Style Sheet Revision Log
---
The below is a history log of changes made to the style sheet.
There are 2 versions of the style sheet, with a different look and 
feel. v1.1 has java script which caused some issues with rendering
and was taken out in v1.2. Also the main changes included moving
the "more administrative details" to the bottom of the document so
the clinician could see straight about the "clinically relevant" 
data first without having to scroll down the page. Section headers
and indentations were also introduced for better readability.

Version 1.1.x, 1.2.x will not me maintained any further unless any major 
bug is found.
Version 1.3.x will continue to be maintained adding any further
functionality deemed necessary or requested.
